## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Report

**PDF File:** Video Games Website Analysis Using Google Lighthouse.pdf

#### Reflection
I have known that it is hard to create a website that can satisty a lot of customers that will access the website with both mobile and from computer. Thus We need to take a lot of consideration to make a good website that can meet the condition of a good website. For suggestio. I suggest that the limit for a report should be more than 5 as we cannot insert that man information from our research especially if tyou want us to provide the picture also.


### Assignment 2: Website
**Website:** https://tmanlip.github.io/

#### Reflection
I have learned the basic of creating a website expecially using grid as the grid is important for us so that our website is structured and easy to read. Using css is very good for the styling that will be implemented on the majority of the website. For improvement. WE need to study more about the usage of CSS and HTML as it is very important so that we will not mess up our website.

### Assignment 3: Github E-Portfolio

**Website:** https://tmanlip.github.io/tmanlip1.github.io/
#### Reflection
I learned that we need to have our public resume or repositories for IT niche as other people can see what we currently working on and what are the progress of other works. For the improvement, I need to research more about GitHub as From my perspective, it is a good space for the IT workers to do their job especially group work as we can monitor everyone.

## Projects

**Our System:** https://tppo.000webhostapp.com/

#### Parcel Tracking System
This system objective is to ease the student in checking whether their parcel has arrive at the One Stop Parcel or Chengal Parcel Point rather than trying their luck to check whether the parcel has arrived or not. In addition, this system will integrate both pick up point in one system rather than separate system as both have the same work flow. 

Our System:

##### Reflection
I have learned on how to make a full functional website using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL for database. From these programming, I think that I already have a basic on how to build a complete website that will require the real time management. For improvement, I hope that we can get a systematic time management on our project so that we can have a proper time to discuss about our project.
